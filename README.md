# ser-model
 A machine learning-based emotion classifier that detects human emotions from voice recordings using audio feature extraction and classification algorithms.
# Emotion Classifier

This project implements an **Emotion Classifier** that detects human emotions from audio input. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes voice recordings to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more.

## Features
- **Input:** Voice/audio recordings
- **Preprocessing:** Extracts features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from audio
- **Model:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, MLP) for classification
- **Output:** Predicts the emotional state with confidence scores
- **Use Cases:** Can be used in mental health apps, customer support systems, voice assistants, and interactive entertainment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Librosa (for audio feature extraction)
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model building)
- Flask (optional, for API deployment)
